# traffic-volume-prediction- using NN 

This code comprises of: 
1. Removing and feature scaling neccessary features alone 
2. Building a 3-Layer neural network and fitting/training it 
3. Predicting the traffic volume (Regression) for the test set

The code is entirely done using a Google Colab notebook with predictions pushed to Drive in csv format.
